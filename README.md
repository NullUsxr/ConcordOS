<h2><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NullUsxr/ConcordOS/main/Images/logo2.png" height="256" width="384"> Concord OS is a community-based operating system that will provide a secure, efficient, and easy-to-use alternative to the operating systems today. We are building this Operating System kernel-up, so it will not be a fork of linux, unix or any other kernels that exist today.</h2>
